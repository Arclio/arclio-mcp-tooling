### ** Integration with `create_slide_with_elements`**

Currently, chart creation is a dedicated tool. It can be merged into our primary `create_slide_with_elements` tool for a more unified interface.

#### **Required Changes:**
To achieve this, we would need to:
1.  Add a new element `type` called `'chart'`.
2.  The `create_slide_with_elements` tool would need to be updated to loop through its elements, and if it finds one of `type: 'chart'`, it would execute the logic currently contained within `insert_chart_from_data`. This logic could be refactored into a private helper function that both tools could call.

#### **Shift in Interaction Model:**
The agent's interaction would evolve from two separate steps to a single, more complex step.

*   **Current Model (Two Steps):**
    1. `create_slide(...)` -> returns `slide_id`
    2. `insert_chart_from_data(slide_id=...)`

*   **Future Integrated Model (One Step):**
    ```json
    {
      "tool_name": "create_slide_with_elements",
      "parameters": {
        "presentation_id": "...",
        "create_slide": true,
        "elements": [
          {
            "type": "textbox",
            "content": "Sales Chart",
            "position": { ... }
          },
          {
            "type": "chart",
            "content": {
              "chart_type": "BAR",
              "title": "Monthly Sales",
              "data": [["Month", "Sales"], ["Jan", 1500]]
            },
            "position": { "x": 50, "y": 150, "width": 480, "height": 320 }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

This creates a more powerful, all-in-one slide creation tool but requires the LLM to construct a more complex JSON payload.

### **2. How Domain-Based Slide Sharing Works**

#### **Sharing Mechanism**
The `share_presentation_with_domain` tool provides a simple way to grant view access to a presentation for everyone within a specific Google Workspace domain.

It uses the `DriveService` to make a `permissions.create` API call on the given file ID. The key parameters in this call are:
*   `type`: `'domain'`
*   `role`: `'reader'`
*   `domain`: The specific domain name (e.g., "rizzbuzz.com")

This instantly applies the permission without sending an email notification to every user in the domain.

#### **Modifying the Sharing Configuration**
To change the domain, modify the hardcoded value in the `share_presentation_with_domain` tool.

#### **Extending to Public or Broader Sharing**
To make a presentation accessible to **anyone on the internet with the link**, you can modify the `share_file_with_domain` method in `src/google_workspace_mcp/services/drive.py`.

**To make a file public:**
Change the `permission` object to use `type: 'anyone'`.

*   **File:** `src/google_workspace_mcp/services/drive.py`
*   **Method:** `share_file_with_domain`

**Example Modification for Public Sharing:**

```python
# (Inside share_file_with_domain method)
...
        try:
            # For public sharing, change the permission object
            permission = {
                'type': 'anyone', # Changed from 'domain'
                'role': 'reader'
            }
            # The 'domain' key is no longer needed

            permission_result = self.service.permissions().create(
                fileId=file_id,
                body=permission,
                supportsAllDrives=True
            ).execute()
...
```
This change would make the file publicly viewable, expanding its accessibility beyond a single organization.
