# Slide 1: Basic Structure & Slide-Level Metadata
# The Title of the Presentation [color=blue][fontsize=48]

<!-- notes: This is the first slide. It demonstrates the most basic features: a title, subtitle, content, footer, and speaker notes. The directives are on the same line as the title and should apply ONLY to the title element. -->

## A Subtitle for the Presentation [fontsize=24]

This is the main content of the first slide. It's a simple paragraph in the implicit root section.

Footer for Slide 1 | Â© 2024

# Slide 2: Section-Scoped Directives

[background=#333333][color=white][padding=20]
This is the first section. The directives above apply to this section because they are the first thing in this section's content block.

---
[background=#EEEEEE][color=black][padding=10][border=2pt solid #cccccc]
This is the second section, styled independently from the first.

This section also contains a **bolded** word and an *italicized* one.

===
# Slide 3: Columnar Layout (Horizontal Sections)

This text is in the first column. It will take up the remaining space after the explicitly sized columns are accounted for.

***
[width=25%]
This text is in the second column. It is explicitly sized to take up 25% of the available width.

***
[width=150]
This text is in the third column. It is sized to be exactly 150 points wide.

===
# Slide 4: Nested Layouts

This is the top-level section content.

---
[background=#f0f0f0]
This is the second top-level section. It contains nested columns.

[width=0.6]
This is the left column inside the second section. It has its own width directive.

***
[width=0.4]
This is the right column inside the second section.

===
# Slide 5: Code Blocks and Separator Escaping

This slide demonstrates that section separators inside code blocks are ignored.

```python
# This is not a real title
# ---
# ***
# ===
def my_function():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

This text appears after the code block, in the same section.

===
# Slide 6: Element-Scoped Directives

This is a standard paragraph.

[align=center]
This paragraph is specifically centered because the directive immediately precedes it.

This is another standard paragraph, which should default to left alignment.

---
[align=right]
> This is a right-aligned blockquote. The directive applies to the entire quote block.

===
# Slide 7: Table with Directives

[column-widths=100,200,100][cell-background=#333][color=white]
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|:---|:---:|---:|
| Left | Center | Right |
| Data | Data | Data |

===
# Slide 8: List with Nested Directives

- Top level item 1.
- [fontsize=18][color=red]
  This second top-level item is styled by the directive above it.
  - Nested item 2.1. It should inherit the red color and font size.
  - [color=green]
    Nested item 2.2 is green, overriding the parent's color.
- Top level item 3.

===
# Slide 9: Image with Element-Scoped Directive

This is a paragraph above the image.

![An image of a mountain](image.png) [border=3pt dotted blue][align=center]

This is a caption below the image. It should not have a border.

===
# Slide 10: Empty Sections and Whitespace Robustness

This section has content.

---
[width=100]

---

This third section has content. The middle section was empty except for a directive. It should still be created and hold its place in the layout, with the specified width.
